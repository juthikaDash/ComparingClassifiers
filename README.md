# ComparingClassifiers
In this practical application assignment, my goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers such as:
  * k-nearest neighbors(KNN)
  * Logistic Regression(LR)
  * Decision Trees(DT) 
  * Support Vector Machines(SVM)
on Bank marketing data

## Dataset: 
The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y). There are 16 features and 45211 rows of data.
